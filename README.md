# Lagrange
Cryptographic algorithms with z3 solver sat.
Multiple primary classes are implemented:
- AES
- SHA224, 256, 384 and 512
- RSA

Other composed classes are implemented to preform some attacks:
- AES with CBC, OFB, CFB or CTR mode (based on AES)
- AES with Hamming Weight (attack based on Hamming Weigth)
- DFA (Differntial Fault Analysis based on AES)
